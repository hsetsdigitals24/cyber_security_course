## Lesson Overview

Network segmentation divides infrastructure into zones and controls traffic between them. Effective segmentation reduces attack surface, limits lateral movement, contains incidents, and protects systems with different business and security requirements.

This lesson covers VLANs, DMZ architecture, access control lists (ACLs), traffic isolation, and segmentation best practices. It builds on pfSense routing, firewall rules, NAT, logging, and stateful inspection from Lesson 23.

<a id="lesson-24-section-02"></a>
## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to:

- Explain segmentation, microsegmentation, and traffic isolation.
- Describe VLAN tagging, access ports, trunks, and inter-VLAN routing.
- Explain why VLANs require enforcement controls.
- Design DMZ ingress, egress, management, and back-end flows.
- Distinguish network ACLs from filesystem and identity ACLs.
- Build and validate a segmentation matrix.
- Identify segmentation bypass and failure conditions.
- Investigate and contain cross-zone traffic.

<a id="lesson-24-section-03"></a>
## Prerequisite Knowledge

Students should understand IP addressing, routing, switching, firewalls, stateful rules, NAT, DHCP, DNS, VPNs, and pfSense from Lessons 8, 16, 22, and 23.

<a id="lesson-24-section-04"></a>
## Enterprise Relevance

Segmentation separates:

- Users from servers.
- Guests from corporate resources.
- Payment systems from general business systems.
- Clinical devices from ordinary workstations.
- Students from administrative services.
- Public services from internal networks.
- Management interfaces from users.
- Development from production.
- Cloud workloads by application and sensitivity.

Flat networks allow one compromise to reach far more systems.

<a id="lesson-24-section-05"></a>
## 1. Network Segmentation

Network segmentation divides a network into controlled zones based on function, sensitivity, trust, exposure, or administrative need.

It limits who and what can communicate, reducing attack paths and incident impact.

Segmentation combines:

- Subnets.
- VLANs.
- Routers.
- Firewalls.
- ACLs.
- Host firewalls.
- Cloud security controls.
- Identity-aware policy.

Segmentation operates in campuses, data centers, branches, cloud virtual networks, industrial environments, and endpoint networks.

<a id="lesson-24-section-06"></a>
## 2. Segmentation Objectives

- Reduce lateral movement.
- Limit broadcast domains.
- Protect high-value assets.
- Separate different trust levels.
- Enforce compliance scope.
- Improve monitoring.
- Contain malware.
- Restrict management.
- Support service availability.

Segmentation should follow data and business flows, not only organizational charts.

<a id="lesson-24-section-07"></a>
## 3. Physical and Logical Segmentation

### Physical

Uses separate switching, cabling, devices, or infrastructure.

Benefits:

- Strong separation.
- Clear failure boundaries.

Costs:

- Higher expense.
- Operational complexity.

### Logical

Uses VLANs, virtual networks, routing, ACLs, and software-defined controls on shared infrastructure.

Benefits:

- Flexibility.
- Scalability.
- Lower hardware cost.

Risks:

- Misconfiguration.
- Shared control-plane compromise.
- Hidden dependencies.

<a id="lesson-24-section-08"></a>
## 4. VLANs

A virtual LAN (VLAN) creates a logical Layer 2 broadcast domain on switching infrastructure.

It separates devices without requiring a separate physical switch for every zone.

Ethernet frames may be assigned to VLANs by switch-port configuration and, on trunk links, commonly identified with IEEE 802.1Q tags.

VLANs separate users, voice, guests, servers, management, IoT, and other device classes.

<a id="lesson-24-section-09"></a>
## 5. Access Ports and Trunks

### Access Port

Typically carries one assigned VLAN for an endpoint. Frames to and from the endpoint are commonly untagged from the endpoint's perspective.

### Trunk Port

Carries multiple VLANs between switches, routers, firewalls, hypervisors, or access points using tagging.

### Native VLAN

Some trunk configurations carry one VLAN untagged. Native-VLAN mismatches can create connectivity and security problems.

Security practices:

- Disable unused ports.
- Assign unused ports to an unused VLAN.
- Restrict allowed VLANs on trunks.
- Avoid user endpoints on trunk ports.
- Use explicit native-VLAN design.
- Monitor topology and configuration changes.

<a id="lesson-24-section-10"></a>
## 6. VLAN Is Not a Complete Security Boundary

Devices in different VLANs cannot communicate at Layer 2 directly under normal design, but inter-VLAN routing may permit communication.

A secure boundary requires:

- Layer 3 routing through an enforcement point.
- Firewall or ACL policy.
- Correct switch configuration.
- Protected management plane.
- Host controls.
- Monitoring.

Putting a sensitive server in a different VLAN while allowing unrestricted inter-VLAN routing provides little security benefit.

<a id="lesson-24-section-11"></a>
## 7. Inter-VLAN Routing

Routing between VLANs may occur on:

<!-- HSETS-ADDED-EXPLANATION-24 -->
A VLAN separates a Layer 2 broadcast domain. Communication between different VLANs requires a device that routes between their IP networks. That routing point is where access policy can control many inter-segment flows. Creating two VLAN names without controlling the permitted routes does not establish the intended security separation.

Begin with the business communication requirement. A student device may need access to a learning server without needing the administrative file share. The policy should identify the source segment, destination, service and direction. Test a permitted flow and a prohibited one from the actual source segment. A failed ping alone does not prove that all access is blocked, because the policy may treat ICMP differently from the application protocol you need to evaluate.
<!-- /HSETS-ADDED-EXPLANATION -->

- Router.
- Firewall.
- Layer 3 switch.
- Virtual router.
- Cloud routing service.

Design choice:

- A firewall provides stateful policy and richer logging.
- A Layer 3 switch provides high-performance routing and ACLs but may offer different inspection depth.

High-risk boundaries should use controls appropriate to the threat and evidence requirements.

<a id="lesson-24-section-12"></a>
## 8. VLAN Threats

Potential risks:

- VLAN hopping through misconfigured trunks.
- Double tagging under specific native-VLAN conditions.
- Unauthorized trunk negotiation.
- Management-plane compromise.
- Rogue switch.
- Incorrect access-port assignment.
- Hypervisor virtual-switch misconfiguration.

Defenses:

- Disable automatic trunk negotiation where appropriate.
- Explicitly configure ports.
- Restrict trunk VLAN lists.
- Use an unused native VLAN where design supports it.
- Secure switch administration.
- Apply network access control.
- Audit configuration.

<a id="lesson-24-section-13"></a>
## 9. DMZ Architecture

A demilitarized zone is a controlled network segment for systems requiring exposure to less trusted networks.

It limits direct paths from public services into internal systems.

Firewalls enforce separate flows:

- Internet to DMZ.
- DMZ to internal.
- Internal to DMZ.
- Management to DMZ.
- DMZ to Internet.

DMZs host reverse proxies, web servers, email gateways, authoritative DNS, remote-access gateways, and transfer services.

<a id="lesson-24-section-14"></a>
## 10. DMZ Traffic Policy

### Inbound

Allow only published services to specific hosts.

### Back-End

Allow only required application-to-service flows, such as a web tier to one database endpoint.

### Egress

Restrict outbound communication to updates, DNS, monitoring, or application requirements. Unrestricted egress enables command and control and exfiltration.

### Management

Use a dedicated management zone, bastion, strong identity, and monitored administration. Do not manage exposed systems directly from ordinary user networks.

<a id="lesson-24-section-15"></a>
## 11. DMZ Design Patterns

### Single Firewall

One firewall separates Internet, DMZ, and internal interfaces.

### Dual Firewall

Separate external and internal enforcement layers. This can improve defense in depth if independently managed and correctly designed, but complexity can introduce gaps.

### Cloud DMZ

Uses public and private subnets, application gateways, network security controls, and controlled routing.

The security objective matters more than the number of firewalls.

<a id="lesson-24-section-16"></a>
## 12. Access Control Lists

A network ACL is an ordered set of permit or deny conditions controlling traffic.

ACLs enforce which sources can reach destinations using selected protocols and ports.

Fields may include:

- Direction.
- Source.
- Destination.
- Protocol.
- Port.
- Action.
- Logging.

ACLs appear on routers, switches, firewalls, cloud networks, wireless systems, and hosts.

<a id="lesson-24-section-17"></a>
## 13. Network ACL Context

Do not confuse:

- Network ACL: controls traffic.
- Filesystem ACL: controls file access.
- Active Directory ACL: controls directory-object rights.

The common concept is ordered access entries, but enforcement objects and semantics differ.

<a id="lesson-24-section-18"></a>
## 14. Standard and Extended ACL Concepts

Traditional network-device terminology may distinguish:

- Standard ACL: primarily source-address matching.
- Extended ACL: source, destination, protocol, and port matching.

Modern platforms vary. Students should inspect actual platform capabilities, direction, order, implicit behavior, and statefulness.

<a id="lesson-24-section-19"></a>
## 15. Stateless ACLs

A stateless ACL evaluates packets independently. Return traffic may require an explicit reverse permit.

Cloud network ACLs may be stateless, while security groups may be stateful, depending on platform.

Stateful firewall behavior should not be assumed for every ACL.

<a id="lesson-24-section-20"></a>
## 16. ACL Design

Principles:

- Default deny.
- Most specific required flows.
- Place controls near an effective enforcement point.
- Avoid `any any`.
- Use object groups or aliases carefully.
- Add descriptions.
- Log high-value denies and selected permits.
- Review shadowed and redundant entries.
- Assign owner and expiry.

An explicit deny placed before a required allow can shadow the allow. A broad allow before a deny can make the deny ineffective.

<a id="lesson-24-section-21"></a>
## 17. Traffic Isolation

### North-South Traffic

Traffic entering or leaving a data center, campus, cloud, or application environment.

### East-West Traffic

Traffic among internal systems, workloads, or zones.

Perimeter firewalls mainly observe north-south paths. Internal segmentation is required to control east-west movement.

<a id="lesson-24-section-22"></a>
## 18. Microsegmentation

Microsegmentation applies granular policy among individual workloads, applications, or small groups.

Traditional network zones may still contain many systems that should not communicate freely.

Controls may use:

- Host-based firewalls.
- Hypervisor policy.
- Cloud security groups.
- Software-defined networking.
- Workload identity.
- Service mesh policy.

Microsegmentation is common in data centers, cloud workloads, virtual environments, and high-security application tiers.

<a id="lesson-24-section-23"></a>
## 19. Microsegmentation Challenges

- Incomplete asset inventory.
- Unknown application dependencies.
- Dynamic workloads and addresses.
- Policy sprawl.
- Agent failure.
- Troubleshooting complexity.
- Emergency exceptions.
- Inconsistent identity labels.

Start with observation, map dependencies, stage enforcement, and validate denied traffic.

<a id="lesson-24-section-24"></a>
## 20. Private VLAN and Client Isolation

Private VLANs or wireless client-isolation controls can restrict peer-to-peer communication within a larger segment.

Use cases:

- Guest Wi-Fi.
- Hosting networks.
- IoT.
- Student devices.

Limitations:

- Shared gateways remain reachable.
- Misconfigured infrastructure can bypass isolation.
- Required peer services may fail.
- It does not replace endpoint security.

<a id="lesson-24-section-25"></a>
## 21. Management-Plane Isolation

Management interfaces should be reachable only from:

- Dedicated management networks.
- Privileged workstations.
- Bastions.
- Approved administrator identities.

Protect:

- Switches.
- Firewalls.
- Hypervisors.
- Domain controllers.
- EDR consoles.
- Backup systems.
- Cloud control planes.

A user-network compromise should not provide direct management access.

<a id="lesson-24-section-26"></a>
## 22. Identity-Aware Segmentation

Network identity can supplement address-based policy:

- User role.
- Device certificate.
- Device posture.
- Workload identity.
- Application identity.

Identity-aware controls improve flexibility but depend on identity-provider availability, accurate attributes, and secure integration.

<a id="lesson-24-section-27"></a>
## 23. Segmentation Matrix

Required fields:

| Source Zone | Destination Zone | Application | Protocol/Port | Initiator | Owner | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Users | DNS | Name resolution | TCP/UDP 53 | User endpoint | Infrastructure | Allow |
| Guest | Internal | Any | Any | Guest | Security | Deny |
| Web DMZ | Database | Application DB | Required port | Web server | App owner | Allow |
| Management | Servers | Administration | Approved protocols | PAW | IT | Allow |

The matrix is a design and review artifact. Technical rules must be validated against it.

<a id="lesson-24-section-28"></a>
## 24. Segmentation Validation

Test:

- Required flows succeed.
- Unrequired neighboring ports fail.
- Reverse initiation fails where not allowed.
- IPv4 and IPv6 match policy.
- Alternate paths do not bypass control.
- VPN and wireless users receive intended policy.
- DNS and management remain controlled.
- Logs identify enforcement.

Testing only successful flows is insufficient.

<a id="lesson-24-section-29"></a>
## 25. Segmentation Failure Modes

| Failure | Impact |
|---|---|
| Any-any rule | Reconnects zones broadly |
| Dual-homed host | Becomes alternate path |
| Uncontrolled VPN | Bypasses zone policy |
| Host firewall disabled | Removes microsegmentation |
| Trunk misconfiguration | Exposes unintended VLAN |
| Shared management network | Expands control-plane attack surface |
| IPv6 omitted | Creates unfiltered alternate path |
| Stale exception | Preserves obsolete access |
| Asymmetric route | Breaks state or inspection |

<a id="lesson-24-section-30"></a>
## 26. Segmentation and Encryption

Segmentation controls reachability. Encryption protects communication content and authentication.

Use both:

- TLS for application traffic.
- SSH for administration.
- SMB encryption/signing where required.
- IPsec for selected system paths.

An allowed flow can still be intercepted or abused if the application protocol is weak.

<a id="lesson-24-section-31"></a>
## 27. Enterprise Scenarios

### Small Business

Users, servers, printers, and cameras share one LAN. VLANs and firewall policy separate users, servers, guests, and IoT while preserving required printing.

### Financial Institution

Cardholder systems are isolated from general corporate networks. A controlled jump host, specific application flows, and monitored administrative paths reduce compliance scope.

### Healthcare Organization

Legacy clinical devices cannot run EDR. Segmentation restricts them to required servers, DNS, time, and vendor destinations, with IDS monitoring.

### Educational Institution

Student devices are isolated from one another and blocked from administrative networks while retaining learning and Internet access.

### Government Agency

A public web tier, application tier, and database tier use separate zones. No Internet-initiated path reaches the database directly.

### Cloud Environment

Security groups permit only workload-to-workload application flows. Flow logs detect a new unauthorized east-west connection.

<a id="lesson-24-section-32"></a>
## 28. Incident Response

During an incident:

- Quarantine a host or zone.
- Block indicators and behaviors.
- Preserve required management access.
- Avoid disrupting critical care or safety systems.
- Capture firewall, switch, flow, DHCP, DNS, and endpoint evidence.
- Check alternate paths.
- Record emergency rules.
- Remove emergency rules after recovery.

Segmentation can contain an incident, but hurried changes can destroy evidence or cause outages.

<a id="lesson-24-section-33"></a>
## 29. Segmentation Governance

Required processes:

- Architecture ownership.
- Asset and flow inventory.
- Rule requests and approvals.
- Exception expiry.
- Periodic recertification.
- Change validation.
- Configuration backup.
- Drift detection.
- Incident testing.

Metrics:

- Any-any rules.
- Expired exceptions.
- Unused rules.
- Unmanaged zones.
- Denied-flow trends.
- Time to quarantine.
- IPv6 policy coverage.

<a id="lesson-24-section-34"></a>
## 30. Security+ SY0-701 Alignment

This lesson supports VLANs, ACLs, DMZs, segmentation, microsegmentation, Zero Trust, traffic isolation, secure protocols, and incident containment.

VLAN configuration, ACLs, and host firewall policy are technical controls. Flow review, validation, and emergency-rule removal are operational controls. Segmentation standards are managerial controls and directive in function.

<a id="lesson-24-section-35"></a>
