## Practical Consolidation Programme

Use the [practical programme guide](practicals/README.md), [seven tool labs](practicals/labs/README.md), and [ten professional projects](practicals/projects/README.md). The project index also contains one optional challenge brief. These counts reflect the files adopted from the reference repository.

Read the lessons in numerical order. Lesson 10 introduces virtualisation. For earlier lesson activities that require a prepared range, use instructor-supplied evidence first and return to live implementation after Lesson 10 and the applicable tool lab. No learner installation is assumed before the setup lesson.
