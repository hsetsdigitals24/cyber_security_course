## Lesson Overview

Enterprise security depends on how controls work together across business services, identities, endpoints, networks, applications, cloud platforms, monitoring, response, and recovery. A strong component can still fail when a dependency, trust relationship, or operational process is weak.

This lesson integrates the course through architecture walkthroughs, system-hardening review, Zero Trust principles, and gap identification. Students will assess an enterprise as a connected system rather than as a list of products.

<a id="lesson-39-section-02"></a>
## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to:

- Conduct a business-led security architecture walkthrough.
- Trace data, identities, administrative paths, dependencies, and trust boundaries.
- Evaluate preventive, detective, corrective, compensating, deterrent, and directive functions.
- Review Windows, Linux, Active Directory, network, endpoint, cloud, and application hardening.
- Apply Zero Trust principles without treating Zero Trust as a product.
- Identify control gaps, overlaps, single points of failure, and untested assumptions.
- Validate that telemetry, detection, incident response, and recovery support the architecture.
- Prioritize findings using evidence, exploit paths, asset criticality, and residual risk.
- Produce technical and executive integration-review outputs.

<a id="lesson-39-section-03"></a>
## Prerequisite Knowledge

Students should understand all concepts from Lessons 1-38, including threats, cryptography, identity, operating systems, network controls, cloud, vulnerability management, SIEM, detection engineering, incident response, forensics, risk, compliance, and reporting.

<a id="lesson-39-section-04"></a>
## Enterprise Relevance

Integration reviews support:

- New system and cloud-service approval.
- Mergers and acquisitions.
- Major architecture changes.
- Zero Trust programs.
- Internal audit and compliance.
- Incident lessons learned.
- Ransomware resilience.
- Supplier and remote-access assessment.
- Annual security-program review.

The goal is not to draw an attractive diagram. The goal is to verify that actual architecture and operations protect the business service under realistic failure and attack conditions.

<a id="lesson-39-section-05"></a>
## Architecture and Dependency Review

An integration review starts with a business service, not an isolated device. The reviewer traces identities, data, administrative paths, trust boundaries, and dependencies so that individual controls can be evaluated in the context of the service they protect.

### Security Architecture Walkthrough

A security architecture walkthrough is a structured examination of how a business service is designed, operated, monitored, and recovered.

Security weaknesses frequently exist between components:

- An application uses MFA, but its service account has excessive privilege.
- Servers are patched, but the backup console shares compromised credentials.
- A firewall blocks inbound traffic, but unrestricted outbound traffic enables command and control.
- Logs exist locally, but an attacker can erase them before collection.

Trace:

1. Business purpose and criticality.
2. Users and administrators.
3. Data and transactions.
4. Components and dependencies.
5. Trust boundaries.
6. Entry and exit paths.
7. Security controls.
8. Telemetry and detection.
9. Response authority and procedures.
10. Backup, recovery, and continuity.

Walkthroughs apply to on-premises systems, SaaS, IaaS, hybrid identity, branch networks, industrial or clinical environments, remote work, and supplier-hosted services.

### Start with the Business Service

Document:

- Service owner.
- Users and customers.
- Supported mission or revenue.
- Critical time periods.
- Maximum tolerable disruption.
- Data sensitivity.
- Legal and contractual obligations.
- Upstream and downstream dependencies.
- Manual workarounds.

A server is not the business service. For example, online banking depends on DNS, identity, certificates, APIs, transaction databases, fraud monitoring, support teams, telecommunications, and recovery processes.

### Build an Evidence-Based Architecture View

Use multiple evidence sources:

- Asset and cloud inventories.
- Network and data-flow diagrams.
- DNS, DHCP, routing, and firewall configuration.
- Identity-role and privileged-access exports.
- Endpoint and server baselines.
- Application and infrastructure-as-code repositories.
- Vulnerability and configuration scan results.
- SIEM ingestion and detection coverage.
- Backup configuration and recovery tests.
- Contracts and shared-responsibility records.
- Interviews and direct observation.

Diagrams and inventories can be wrong. Reconcile documentation with observed configuration and telemetry.

### Trust Boundaries and Data Flows

A trust boundary separates components with different identities, ownership, privilege, exposure, or security assumptions. A data flow shows how information moves between entities, processes, and storage.

<!-- HSETS-ADDED-EXPLANATION-39 -->
A diagram becomes useful when each connection explains what moves, who initiates it and what authority is required. A line between two boxes is not enough to establish that a flow is necessary or controlled. Add the relevant service, identity and direction, then identify the point where the access decision is enforced.

Trace one ordinary business transaction from beginning to end, including dependencies such as identity, name resolution, certificates and storage. Then ask what happens when a dependency fails or an account is misused. Compare the documented path with configuration and observed evidence. This can reveal a gap between components even when each component passes its own checklist. Record assumptions that remain untested instead of presenting a tidy diagram as proof of the actual environment.
<!-- /HSETS-ADDED-EXPLANATION -->

Attacks cross boundaries. The review must identify what authenticates each crossing, what is authorized, what is encrypted, what is logged, and what happens when validation fails.

For every flow, ask:

- Source and destination?
- Protocol and port?
- User, workload, or device identity?
- Authentication and authorization mechanism?
- Encryption and certificate validation?
- Data classification?
- Input validation?
- Logging and alerting?
- Failure and retry behavior?
- Owner?

Important boundaries include internet-to-DMZ, user-to-application, application-to-database, and on-premises-to-cloud connections. Administrative, supplier, backup, clinical, and operational network boundaries also require explicit review.

### Administrative Paths

Administrative access can bypass normal application controls. Trace:

- Privileged workstations.
- VPN or Zero Trust access.
- Bastion hosts.
- PAM activation.
- RDP, SSH, PowerShell remoting, and cloud consoles.
- Emergency accounts.
- Service and automation identities.
- Hypervisor, backup, and security-tool consoles.
- Domain, tenant, and subscription administration.

Validate:

- MFA and phishing-resistant methods where appropriate.
- Separate privileged accounts.
- Least privilege and time-bound elevation.
- Device health.
- Source restrictions.
- Session and activity logging.
- Credential rotation.
- Break-glass monitoring and testing.

An isolated workload is not protected if its hypervisor or management plane is broadly accessible.

### Dependency Analysis

Dependencies are services or resources required for operation, security, or recovery.

Hidden dependencies create single points of failure and unexpected blast radius.

Examine:

- DNS and time synchronization.
- Identity provider and directories.
- PKI and key management.
- Network, internet, and telecommunications.
- Cloud regions and platform services.
- Software supply chain.
- Monitoring and ticketing.
- Backup and recovery infrastructure.
- Staff and supplier availability.

Record dependencies in architecture diagrams, configuration management databases, business-impact analysis, risk registers, recovery plans, and supplier inventories.

### Defense-in-Depth Review

Defense in depth uses independent or complementary controls so that one failure does not expose the objective.

Example: protecting a remote administrator:

| Layer | Control |
|---|---|
| Identity | Phishing-resistant MFA and separate privileged account |
| Device | Managed privileged workstation with EDR |
| Access | Time-bound PAM role |
| Network | Restricted management path through bastion |
| Host | Local firewall and hardened remote service |
| Detection | Identity, PAM, bastion, and endpoint correlation |
| Response | Session revocation and account containment playbook |
| Recovery | Tested break-glass and restoration procedure |

Do not count duplicated controls as independent when they share the same failure mode. Two tools using the same compromised identity provider may fail together.

<a id="lesson-39-section-06"></a>
## Integrated Control Review

Hardening cannot be assessed one platform at a time. Windows, Linux, endpoints, networks, cloud services, applications, vulnerability management, telemetry, and recovery controls must support one another across the same attack paths and business dependencies.

### System Hardening Review

Hardening reduces attack surface and constrains behavior by securely configuring systems and removing unnecessary exposure.

Default configurations prioritize broad compatibility and ease of use. Unnecessary services, privileges, software, protocols, and trust increase attack opportunities.

Use approved baselines, configuration management, exception handling, validation, and drift detection.

Apply hardening to endpoints, servers, directory services, network devices, hypervisors, containers, cloud resources, SaaS tenants, applications, and management tools.

### Windows and Active Directory Review

Review:

- Supported versions and patch state.
- Microsoft Defender and EDR health.
- BitLocker coverage and recovery-key governance.
- Local administrator management.
- Windows Firewall profiles.
- PowerShell logging and constrained administration where appropriate.
- Audit policy and event forwarding.
- RDP exposure and Network Level Authentication.
- Service identities and permissions.
- LAPS or equivalent local-password management.
- Domain and forest trust.
- Privileged groups and delegated OU permissions.
- Kerberos encryption and service accounts.
- NTLM reduction and legacy dependencies.
- Group Policy ownership, change control, and drift.
- Domain-controller protection, backup, and recovery.

Evidence should include effective policy, not only intended Group Policy Objects.

### Linux Review

Review:

- Supported distribution and package sources.
- Patch state and repository trust.
- Users, groups, sudoers, and SSH keys.
- File ownership, modes, ACLs, and sensitive paths.
- SSH authentication, root access, and forwarding policy.
- UFW, nftables, or enterprise host firewall.
- systemd services and enabled units.
- Cron and systemd timer persistence.
- Audit, authentication, and journal collection.
- SELinux or AppArmor status where deployed.
- Secrets and service-account permissions.
- Backup and recovery.
- Baseline compliance and drift.

Use `ss`, `systemctl`, package inventory, permissions, logs, and configuration-management evidence to validate the actual state.

### Endpoint Review

Evaluate:

- Asset ownership and enrollment.
- EDR sensor health and tamper protection.
- Anti-malware and exploit protection.
- Disk encryption.
- Patch and vulnerability coverage.
- Application control.
- Browser and email protections.
- USB and removable-media policy.
- Host firewall.
- Local privilege.
- Logging and time synchronization.
- Isolation and reimage procedures.

Coverage percentages need complete denominators. Reporting "98% protected" is unreliable if unknown devices are absent from inventory.

### Network and Remote-Access Review

Review:

- Authoritative network inventory and diagrams.
- VLAN and zone purpose.
- Default-deny and least-access rules.
- DMZ placement.
- East-west traffic controls.
- Administrative-plane isolation.
- Firewall rule ownership, expiration, and logging.
- NAT implications.
- IDS/IPS and Zeek visibility.
- DNS and DHCP security.
- VPN identity, MFA, posture, routing, and logs.
- RDP and SSH exposure.
- Wireless segmentation.
- Cloud connectivity and asymmetric routes.

Validate a rule from source to destination. A firewall entry can exist yet fail because of routing, state, NAT order, or an overlooked alternate path.

### Cloud and SaaS Review

Review:

- Account, subscription, project, and tenant structure.
- Root or global administrator protection.
- Federated identity and emergency access.
- IAM roles and managed identities.
- Public endpoints and storage.
- Security groups, network ACLs, and private connectivity.
- Encryption and key ownership.
- Logging at organization, identity, management, and workload layers.
- Configuration policies and guardrails.
- Backup, snapshots, and cross-account recovery.
- CI/CD and infrastructure-as-code controls.
- Marketplace and OAuth application consent.
- Data sharing and retention.
- Provider and customer responsibilities.

A cloud provider secures the platform; the customer still owns configuration and responsibilities assigned by the service model.

### Application and Data Review

Review:

- Authentication, session, and authorization design.
- Input validation and output encoding.
- Secrets and key management.
- Dependency and software-composition risk.
- Secure development and peer review.
- Build pipeline and artifact integrity.
- Database access.
- Data classification, minimization, retention, and deletion.
- Encryption at rest and in transit.
- API authorization, rate limits, and logging.
- Web application firewall limitations.
- Recovery and integrity validation.

Do not treat TLS as proof that application authorization or input handling is secure.

### Vulnerability and Patch Integration

Verify that:

- Asset inventory defines scan scope.
- Authenticated scans use protected least-privilege credentials.
- Fragile assets have safe methods.
- Findings are validated and deduplicated.
- Threat intelligence and exposure influence priority.
- Tickets have owners and deadlines.
- Change management includes testing and rollback.
- Exceptions expire.
- Remediation is rescanned or otherwise validated.
- Metrics distinguish accepted, mitigated, fixed, and overdue risk.

### Telemetry and Detection Review

Detection coverage is the ability to observe and identify meaningful behavior across relevant attack paths.

Controls fail. Without sufficient telemetry and tested detection logic, incidents remain invisible.

For critical scenarios, map:

- Required data sources.
- Collection path.
- Parsing and normalization.
- Retention.
- Detection rule.
- Threshold and suppression.
- Enrichment.
- Alert owner.
- Investigation steps.
- Response authority.
- Test evidence.

Include identity, endpoint, Windows, Linux, DNS, firewall, VPN, IDS, cloud control plane, SaaS, application, database, and backup telemetry.

#### Coverage Validation

An ATT&CK mapping is not evidence of effective detection. Generate an authorized test event, confirm source logging, collection, parsing, rule execution, alert routing, analyst interpretation, and response.

### Incident Response and Recovery Review

Evaluate:

- Incident policy and authority.
- Contact and escalation records.
- NIST-aligned response process.
- Playbooks for likely scenarios.
- Identity and endpoint containment capability.
- Forensic preservation.
- Legal, privacy, compliance, and communications coordination.
- Supplier response obligations.
- Recovery priorities.
- Offline or immutable backups.
- Restore testing and integrity validation.
- Lessons-learned tracking.

Recovery should not reconnect systems into the same unresolved attack path.

<a id="lesson-39-section-07"></a>
## Zero Trust Evaluation

Zero Trust provides decision principles rather than a product checklist. The review should examine the identity, device, resource, context, policy, telemetry, and recovery evidence used for each access decision while recognizing operational limits and maturity gaps.

### Zero Trust Principles

Zero Trust is an architectural approach that does not grant implicit trust based only on network location, ownership, or a previous authentication. Access is explicitly evaluated using identity, device, resource, context, policy, and risk.

Modern enterprises operate across cloud, SaaS, remote work, suppliers, mobile devices, and hybrid infrastructure. A trusted internal network is too broad a security boundary.

Apply:

- Explicit verification.
- Least-privilege access.
- Assume breach.
- Strong identity.
- Device and workload posture.
- Resource-level policy.
- Segmentation.
- Continuous telemetry and reevaluation.
- Automated response with safeguards.

Zero Trust applies to users, administrators, service identities, APIs, workloads, data, remote access, cloud management, and internal applications.

### Zero Trust Decision Flow

An access decision may evaluate:

1. Subject identity and authentication strength.
2. Device identity, management, encryption, and risk.
3. Requested resource and action.
4. User and resource sensitivity.
5. Time, location, behavior, and threat context.
6. Policy and risk threshold.
7. Permit, deny, limit, or require stronger verification.
8. Log, monitor, and reevaluate the session.

Access granted at 09:00 should not necessarily remain trusted after the device becomes high risk at 09:15.

### Zero Trust Limitations and Misconceptions

Zero Trust does not mean:

- Trusting nobody in a social or employment sense.
- Buying one vendor product.
- Removing all networks or firewalls.
- Prompting for MFA on every click.
- Eliminating availability and recovery needs.
- Automatically blocking all legacy systems.
- Replacing governance, asset inventory, or incident response.

Poorly designed controls can create denial-of-service risk or unsafe workarounds. Use phased deployment and business validation.

### Zero Trust Maturity Questions

Maturity should be judged from verified decision inputs and enforcement behavior rather than product ownership or architecture labels.

| Domain | Review questions |
|---|---|
| Identity | Are users and workloads strongly identified? Is privilege time-bound? |
| Devices | Is health known and continuously evaluated? |
| Applications | Is access resource-specific or broadly network-based? |
| Data | Is sensitivity known and use constrained? |
| Network | Is lateral movement limited and observed? |
| Automation | Can risk trigger safe access changes? |
| Visibility | Can decisions be reconstructed from logs? |
| Governance | Are policies, owners, exceptions, and metrics defined? |

<a id="lesson-39-section-08"></a>
## Gap Analysis and Roadmap

A useful review turns evidence into prioritized action. Gaps should be tied to realistic attack paths and business consequences, then translated into findings with owners, target dates, dependencies, validation criteria, and a feasible improvement sequence.

### Gap Identification

A security gap is a difference between the required or target state and the observed state.

Unstructured concerns do not create accountable remediation.

Record:

- Target or requirement.
- Observed condition.
- Evidence.
- Affected scope.
- Threat scenario.
- Existing controls.
- Business impact.
- Likelihood and confidence.
- Recommendation.
- Owner and due date.
- Residual risk and exception status.
- Validation method.

Track gaps in findings, risk registers, plans of action, remediation tickets, architecture decisions, compliance records, and executive dashboards.

### Gap Types

Classifying a gap helps identify the accountable owner and the kind of corrective work required.

| Type | Example |
|---|---|
| Coverage gap | Cloud audit logs are collected from only two of five subscriptions |
| Design gap | Leaver process omits contractors |
| Operation gap | Required quarterly review was missed |
| Visibility gap | DNS logs lack client identity |
| Integration gap | EDR risk does not influence remote access |
| Resilience gap | Backup console shares domain credentials |
| Governance gap | Firewall exceptions have no owner or expiry |
| Validation gap | Recovery plan has never been tested |

### Attack-Path Analysis

Prioritize connected weaknesses, not isolated scores.

Example path:

1. Phishing captures a user's session.
2. SaaS access permits OAuth application consent.
3. The user can access a shared administration document.
4. The document exposes a service credential.
5. The credential reaches a flat server network.
6. Backup administration uses the same identity plane.

Each issue may appear moderate alone. Together they create a high-impact ransomware and data-exposure path.

Break paths at multiple points through phishing-resistant authentication, consent restrictions, secrets management, least privilege, segmentation, backup isolation, and tested detections.

### Prioritization

Prioritize using:

- Business criticality and safety.
- Data sensitivity.
- Exposure.
- Threat activity.
- Exploit prerequisites.
- Privilege and blast radius.
- Existing controls.
- Detection and recovery capability.
- Compliance deadline.
- Remediation complexity and dependency.

Quick wins matter, but do not allow many easy low-risk actions to displace a difficult material risk.

### Findings and Roadmap

Group actions into:

- **Immediate:** active exposure, containment, or critical control restoration.
- **Near term:** high-risk design and coverage gaps.
- **Planned:** structural improvements requiring projects.
- **Accepted:** approved residual risk with monitoring and expiry.

Every roadmap item needs an accountable owner, resources, dependencies, success measure, and validation.

<a id="lesson-39-section-09"></a>
## Enterprise Review Scenarios

The following scenarios apply the same review method to organizations with different constraints. Each example connects service dependencies, control evidence, attack paths, and remediation priorities instead of producing an isolated checklist.

### Enterprise Scenarios

#### Scenario A: Healthcare Architecture

A clinical device cannot support modern authentication. The organization isolates it, permits only required clinical flows, routes vendor support through PAM and a monitored bastion, passively monitors traffic, and maintains a replacement deadline. Zero Trust is achieved through surrounding controls, not an unsafe forced agent installation.

#### Scenario B: Financial Recovery Gap

The bank has immutable backups, but backup administrators authenticate through the production domain. The review identifies a shared identity failure, separates recovery credentials, hardens the management plane, and conducts a domain-compromise recovery exercise.

#### Scenario C: University Cloud Sprawl

Research subscriptions are missing from central logging. The university establishes organization-level inventory, enrollment guardrails, delegated ownership, minimum log requirements, and a monitored exception path for sensitive experiments.

#### Scenario D: Government Supplier Access

A vendor VPN allows broad network reach during a six-month project. The agency replaces it with approved-device, time-bound, resource-specific access through a bastion and correlates vendor identity, session, endpoint, and target logs.

#### Scenario E: Small Business

A small company cannot implement every advanced tool. It uses CIS IG1 priorities: inventory, MFA, patching, secure configuration, backups, endpoint protection, logging, and an external incident-response contact. Its architecture remains simple and supportable.

### Enterprise Troubleshooting During Review

When a control appears absent:

1. Confirm the expected architecture.
2. Query the authoritative configuration source.
3. Test the actual path safely.
4. Check collection and time synchronization.
5. Identify alternate routes and identities.
6. Distinguish configuration from temporary outage.
7. Record evidence and limitations.
8. Avoid making unapproved production changes during assessment.

For example, a missing SIEM event may indicate source logging disabled, collector failure, parser mismatch, filter suppression, network interruption, clock skew, or wrong query scope.

### Tasks

1. Identify business services, owners, data, and critical dependencies.
2. Build a current-state architecture and data-flow diagram.
3. Mark internet, identity, privilege, management, cloud, vendor, and recovery trust boundaries.
4. Trace one user path, one administrator path, and one service-identity path.
5. Review hardening evidence for Windows, Linux, AD, network, endpoint, and cloud.
6. Map defense-in-depth controls and shared failure modes.
7. Evaluate Zero Trust maturity by domain.
8. Test telemetry and detection for one authorized scenario.

14. A financial institution has strong endpoint protection and SIEM monitoring, but cloud administrator activity is not logged centrally and database backups depend on the same identity provider as production. Identify the visibility, recovery, and shared-failure risks, then recommend practical improvements.
