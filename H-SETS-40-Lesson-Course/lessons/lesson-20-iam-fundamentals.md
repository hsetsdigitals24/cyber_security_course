## Lesson Overview

Identity and Access Management (IAM) governs how human and non-human identities are created, authenticated, authorized, monitored, changed, and retired. Active Directory is one identity platform; enterprise IAM spans directories, cloud platforms, SaaS applications, databases, infrastructure, APIs, devices, and privileged-access systems.

This lesson covers role-based access control (RBAC), least privilege, privileged access management (PAM), account lifecycle management, and privileged-account protection.

<a id="lesson-20-section-02"></a>
## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to:

- Explain IAM, identity governance, authentication, authorization, and accountability.
- Design and evaluate RBAC.
- Apply least privilege to human and workload identities.
- Explain PAM vaulting, rotation, elevation, approval, brokering, and monitoring.
- Build joiner, mover, and leaver lifecycle processes.
- Protect administrative, service, emergency, and shared identities.
- Conduct access reviews and identify privilege creep.
- Investigate identity and privilege events across hybrid environments.

<a id="lesson-20-section-03"></a>
## Prerequisite Knowledge

Students should understand authentication factors, tokens, credential security, Windows SIDs and tokens, Active Directory users, groups, delegation, Kerberos, trusts, and Group Policy from Lessons 5, 17, and 19.

<a id="lesson-20-section-04"></a>
## Enterprise Relevance

IAM determines who can:

- Access payroll.
- Read patient records.
- administer cloud subscriptions.
- Change firewall rules.
- Deploy application code.
- Reset passwords.
- Export customer data.
- Manage domain controllers.

Many security incidents use valid credentials and excessive authorization rather than software exploitation.

<a id="lesson-20-section-05"></a>
## 1. Identity and Access Management

IAM is the combination of governance, processes, technologies, and controls used to manage identities and access.

Organizations need the right identities to receive the right access for the right purpose and duration.

IAM connects:

- Authoritative identity sources.
- Directories and identity providers.
- Authentication methods.
- Authorization models.
- Provisioning and deprovisioning.
- Access requests and approvals.
- Privileged access.
- Logging, review, and certification.

IAM applies to on-premises, cloud, SaaS, applications, networks, databases, endpoints, APIs, physical access, and machine identities.

<a id="lesson-20-section-06"></a>
## 2. Identity Governance and Administration

Identity governance defines:

- Who owns an identity.
- Who approves access.
- Which roles exist.
- Which conflicts are prohibited.
- How access is reviewed.
- How exceptions expire.
- Which evidence proves compliance.

Administration executes lifecycle changes and integrates target systems.

IAM is not only an IT account-creation function. Business owners must define appropriate access.

<a id="lesson-20-section-07"></a>
## 3. Authentication and Authorization

Authentication verifies identity. Authorization determines allowed actions.

Example:

1. An analyst authenticates with a passkey.
2. The identity provider issues a token.
3. The SIEM validates the token.
4. Role and policy grant query access.
5. Sensitive rule deletion remains prohibited.
6. Activity is logged.

Strong MFA cannot correct excessive authorization.

<a id="lesson-20-section-08"></a>
## 4. Authorization Models

| Model | Decision Basis | Example |
|---|---|---|
| RBAC | Assigned role | SOC Tier 1 can triage alerts |
| ABAC | Attributes and policy | Managed device and approved location required |
| Rule-based | Explicit system rules | Firewall allows approved subnet |
| Discretionary | Resource owner controls access | File owner grants another user access |
| Mandatory | Centrally enforced labels and policy | Classified data access by clearance |

Enterprises often combine models.

<a id="lesson-20-section-09"></a>
## 5. Role-Based Access Control

RBAC assigns permissions to roles and users to appropriate roles.

It reduces direct user entitlements and aligns access with job functions.

```text
User -> Business Role -> Technical Entitlements -> Resources
```

RBAC appears in Active Directory groups, cloud roles, databases, SaaS applications, SIEM platforms, and business systems.

<a id="lesson-20-section-10"></a>
## 6. RBAC Design

1. Identify business functions.
2. Inventory permissions and resources.
3. Define role purpose and owner.
4. Assign minimum entitlements.
5. Define eligibility and approval.
6. Test normal and prohibited actions.
7. Review conflicts.
8. Monitor assignments and use.
9. retire unused roles.

### Role Types

- Business role: job function such as Accounts Payable Clerk.
- Technical role: platform permission bundle such as Storage Reader.
- Privileged role: administrative capability.
- Emergency role: temporary crisis access.

<a id="lesson-20-section-11"></a>
## 7. Role Engineering Risks

- **Role explosion:** too many highly specific roles.
- **Over-broad role:** one role grants unrelated privileges.
- **Privilege creep:** access accumulates through job changes.
- **Toxic combination:** separately reasonable roles create fraud or control bypass.
- **Orphan role:** no owner or business purpose.
- **Direct assignment:** bypasses governed role model.

RBAC should not force every exceptional need into a permanent role.

<a id="lesson-20-section-12"></a>
## 8. Separation of Duties

Separation of duties divides sensitive processes among multiple people or roles.

It reduces fraud, error, and unilateral abuse.

Examples:

- Requester cannot approve own access.
- Payment creator cannot release payment.
- Developer cannot directly approve production deployment.
- PAM administrator cannot freely use every vaulted credential.

Apply to finance, identity administration, cloud, code deployment, key management, audit, and security operations.

Small teams may require compensating controls such as independent review, stronger logging, transaction limits, and retrospective approval.

<a id="lesson-20-section-13"></a>
## 9. Least Privilege

Least privilege grants only the access necessary for an approved task, scope, and duration.

It limits errors, misuse, malware impact, and lateral movement.

Apply least privilege across:

- Permissions.
- Resource scope.
- Time.
- Network location.
- device trust.
- command or action.
- data set.

It applies to users, administrators, service accounts, applications, scripts, APIs, databases, and cloud workloads.

<a id="lesson-20-section-14"></a>
## 10. Least Privilege Is Dynamic

A person may need elevated access for one hour to resolve an incident, not permanent membership in an administrator group.

Dynamic controls include:

- Just-in-time access.
- Just-enough administration.
- Time-bound roles.
- Approval workflows.
- Conditional access.
- Session brokering.
- Attribute-based restrictions.

Least privilege must preserve operational capability. Access that is too restrictive may cause unsafe workarounds or service delay.

<a id="lesson-20-section-15"></a>
## 11. Privileged Access

Privileged access can:

- Change security controls.
- Manage identities.
- Access sensitive data.
- Deploy code.
- Alter logs.
- Control infrastructure.
- Assume other roles.

Privilege is broader than "administrator" labels. A user who can edit a startup script executed by root or reset an administrator password has indirect privilege.

<a id="lesson-20-section-16"></a>
## 12. Privileged Access Management

PAM is the governance and technology used to control, protect, monitor, and audit privileged access.

Privileged credentials and sessions have high impact and attract attackers.

PAM capabilities may include:

- Credential vaulting.
- Automatic rotation.
- Access request and approval.
- Session brokering.
- Session recording.
- Just-in-time elevation.
- Command restriction.
- Discovery of privileged accounts.
- Check-out and check-in.
- Analytics and alerting.

PAM protects operating systems, Active Directory, databases, network devices, cloud roles, applications, secrets, and emergency accounts.

<a id="lesson-20-section-17"></a>
## 13. PAM Architecture

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Vault | Protect credentials and secrets |
| Discovery | Find privileged identities and credentials |
| Rotation engine | Change managed secrets |
| Session proxy | Broker access without revealing credentials |
| Approval workflow | Validate business need |
| Recorder | Capture session evidence |
| Analytics | Detect unusual privilege use |

The PAM platform becomes critical infrastructure. It requires HA, strong administration, backups, monitoring, and emergency recovery.

<a id="lesson-20-section-18"></a>
## 14. Credential Vaulting

Vaulting protects passwords, keys, and secrets through encryption, access control, audit, and rotation.

Security requirements:

- Do not reveal a secret when brokering is possible.
- Separate vault administration from secret use.
- Rotate after use or exposure according to design.
- Prevent secrets in scripts and tickets.
- Monitor export.
- Protect recovery keys.
- Test vault recovery.

Vaulting does not reduce privilege automatically; it controls access to the credential.

<a id="lesson-20-section-19"></a>
## 15. Session Management

PAM may:

- Launch RDP, SSH, database, or web sessions.
- Inject credentials.
- Record commands or video.
- Restrict transfer and clipboard.
- Terminate sessions.

Session recording creates sensitive evidence. Define access, retention, privacy, integrity, and investigation procedures.

Recording is detective and accountability support; it does not prevent every harmful action.

<a id="lesson-20-section-20"></a>
## 16. Account Lifecycle Management

Account lifecycle management controls identities from creation through retirement.

Uncontrolled accounts become orphaned, excessive, stale, or exploitable.

The lifecycle includes:

1. Authoritative identity event.
2. Approval.
3. Provisioning.
4. Authentication enrollment.
5. Access assignment.
6. Monitoring and review.
7. Modification.
8. Suspension or disablement.
9. Deprovisioning.
10. Record retention.

Lifecycle applies to employees, contractors, students, vendors, customers, services, devices, and workloads.

<a id="lesson-20-section-21"></a>
## 17. Joiner Process

Required controls:

- Verify identity and employment or relationship.
- Use a unique identifier.
- Assign baseline access from an approved role.
- Require owner approval for sensitive access.
- Enroll secure authentication.
- Communicate acceptable use.
- Record evidence.
- Avoid copying all access from another user without review.

<a id="lesson-20-section-22"></a>
## 18. Mover Process

Job or responsibility changes can create privilege creep.

<!-- HSETS-ADDED-EXPLANATION-20 -->
A role change is an access review, not simply a request for additional groups. Compare the person's old duties, new duties and current permissions. Some access remains necessary, some becomes unnecessary and some must be added. If each move only adds permissions, the account accumulates authority that no longer matches its work.

Record the business approval and the implementation separately. After the change, test a required new action and an action that the old role permitted but the new role should not. Consider whether current sessions or cached access tokens need to be refreshed under the platform's procedure. A changed membership list documents a configuration change; testing as the intended identity establishes whether the effective access now meets the requirement.
<!-- /HSETS-ADDED-EXPLANATION -->

Mover workflow:

1. Identify new role.
2. Compare current and required access.
3. Remove access no longer needed.
4. Add approved access.
5. Check separation-of-duties conflicts.
6. Review privileged eligibility.
7. Validate with old and new owners.

Adding new access without removing old access is a common failure.

<a id="lesson-20-section-23"></a>
## 19. Leaver Process

Offboarding may require:

- Disable interactive accounts.
- Revoke sessions and tokens.
- Remove MFA devices and passkeys.
- Revoke certificates and keys.
- Remove group and role assignments.
- Disable VPN and remote access.
- Transfer data ownership.
- Rotate shared or exposed secrets.
- Disable service identities associated with the person.
- Preserve evidence for high-risk departures.

Timing depends on risk and employment process. Involuntary departure may require coordinated immediate action.

<a id="lesson-20-section-24"></a>
## 20. Non-Human Identity Lifecycle

Service, application, API, device, and workload identities require:

- Named owner.
- Defined purpose.
- Least privilege.
- Non-interactive restrictions.
- Managed credential or key.
- Rotation.
- Expiration or review date.
- Usage monitoring.
- Decommissioning with the workload.

Workload identities often outnumber human accounts and can become long-lived blind spots.

<a id="lesson-20-section-25"></a>
## 21. Access Requests

A sound request records:

- Requester.
- Beneficiary.
- resource.
- Role or entitlement.
- Business justification.
- Duration.
- Risk.
- Data or system owner.
- Required approvers.
- Separation-of-duties result.

Approval does not prove correct implementation. Provisioning and later removal must be validated.

<a id="lesson-20-section-26"></a>
## 22. Access Reviews

An access review asks accountable owners to confirm whether identities still require access.

Roles, relationships, and risk change over time.

Provide reviewers with:

- Identity.
- Access.
- Source of assignment.
- Last use.
- Risk and privilege.
- Manager and owner.
- Prior decisions.

Reviews cover privileged groups, applications, cloud roles, shared files, service accounts, and third parties.

### Review Quality

Avoid "rubber-stamp" reviews. Use:

- Focused scope.
- Plain-language entitlement descriptions.
- Escalation for non-response.
- Evidence of removal.
- Independent review of high privilege.
- Metrics for revoked access and overdue decisions.

<a id="lesson-20-section-27"></a>
## 23. Privileged Account Types

| Type | Example | Protection |
|---|---|---|
| Named admin | Individual administrator account | MFA, separate account, PAW, JIT |
| Shared emergency | Break-glass account | Vault, dual control, monitoring, test |
| Service account | Application identity | Managed secret, no interactive logon |
| Built-in account | Platform-provided administrator | Restrict, rename only as minor obscurity, monitor |
| Cloud role | Subscription administrator | Time-bound activation and conditional access |
| Vendor account | Third-party support | Sponsor, expiry, limited window, monitoring |

<a id="lesson-20-section-28"></a>
## 24. Privileged Account Protection

- Separate standard and administrative accounts.
- Use phishing-resistant MFA.
- Use privileged access workstations.
- Prohibit privileged logon to lower-trust endpoints.
- Apply JIT and approval.
- Restrict source networks and devices.
- Use PAM brokering.
- Monitor privilege assignment and use.
- Protect recovery.
- Review memberships frequently.
- Alert on dormant privileged use.

<a id="lesson-20-section-29"></a>
## 25. Emergency Access

Break-glass identities support recovery when normal IAM controls fail.

Requirements:

- Exclude from the same failure mode where justified.
- Strong protected credentials.
- Minimal number.
- No routine use.
- Continuous alerting.
- Tested sign-in.
- Documented authorization.
- Post-use rotation and review.

An emergency account that is never tested may not work during an emergency.

<a id="lesson-20-section-30"></a>
## 26. Shared Accounts

Shared accounts weaken accountability because activity cannot be reliably attributed to one person.

Prefer:

- Named identities.
- Role assignment.
- PAM credential injection.
- Session recording.

If unavoidable, apply owner, vaulting, rotation, approval, logging, and narrow scope.

<a id="lesson-20-section-31"></a>
## 27. Cloud and Hybrid IAM

Cloud IAM introduces:

- Tenant-wide roles.
- Resource scopes.
- service principals.
- Managed identities.
- API tokens.
- federation.
- Conditional access.
- Cross-tenant and guest access.

Hybrid risks include:

- Privilege synchronization.
- Stale cloud sessions after on-premises disablement.
- Misaligned lifecycle.
- Excessive application consent.
- On-premises compromise reaching cloud.
- Cloud compromise reaching synchronized identity.

Treat synchronization and federation services as privileged control-plane systems.

<a id="lesson-20-section-32"></a>
## 28. IAM Logging and Detection

Collect:

- Successful and failed authentication.
- MFA registration and reset.
- Role assignment and activation.
- Group membership change.
- Access request and approval.
- Token and session revocation.
- PAM checkout and session.
- Service-account use.
- Application consent.
- Account disablement and deletion.

Detection ideas:

- Privileged role assigned outside process.
- Dormant administrator becomes active.
- Service account logs on interactively.
- MFA method added before privilege use.
- Break-glass account used.
- Privilege activated from unmanaged device.
- Access retained after termination.

<a id="lesson-20-section-33"></a>
## 29. Enterprise Scenarios

### Small Business

One IT administrator uses a shared domain and cloud admin account. The business introduces named admin accounts, MFA, vaulting, emergency access, and independent owner review.

### Financial Institution

A trader requests payment approval access, creating a toxic combination. IAM policy blocks the role combination and routes the exception to risk and compliance.

### Healthcare Organization

A nurse moves to another department but retains access to prior patient records. A mover process removes old role entitlements and validates minimum necessary access.

### Educational Institution

Temporary lecturers remain active after semester end. Expiring affiliations and automated deprovisioning reduce stale accounts.

### Government Agency

A vendor receives privileged access for maintenance. Access is sponsored, time-bound, brokered through PAM, recorded, and automatically removed.

### Cloud Environment

A managed identity receives subscription-wide owner instead of one storage read role. The cloud team narrows scope and monitors prior actions.

<a id="lesson-20-section-34"></a>
## 30. IAM Troubleshooting

When access fails:

1. Confirm identity and authentication.
2. Confirm account state.
3. Identify intended entitlement.
4. Trace direct and inherited assignments.
5. Check role activation and expiry.
6. Check conditional and device policy.
7. Check token issuance time and cached session.
8. Check resource-side authorization.
9. Check separation-of-duties denial.
10. Apply the smallest approved correction.

Do not grant broad administrator access merely to test an access problem.

<a id="lesson-20-section-35"></a>
## 31. IAM Metrics

Useful measures:

- Provisioning and deprovisioning time.
- Orphan accounts.
- Stale privileged accounts.
- Access-review completion and revocation.
- Direct versus role-based assignments.
- Privileged activation duration.
- Service accounts with expired owners.
- MFA and phishing-resistant coverage.
- Emergency-account test status.
- Unresolved separation-of-duties conflicts.

Metrics require context and should drive correction, not only reporting.

<a id="lesson-20-section-36"></a>
## 32. Security+ SY0-701 Alignment

This lesson supports RBAC, least privilege, identity lifecycle, PAM, privileged accounts, MFA, conditional access, separation of duties, account review, and Zero Trust principles.

RBAC enforcement, PAM vaults, and conditional access are technical controls. Provisioning, review, approval, and offboarding are operational controls. IAM standards and separation-of-duties policy are managerial controls and directive in function.

<a id="lesson-20-section-37"></a>
## 33. Classroom Hands-On Practical

### Practical Title

Design and Audit Enterprise Access

### Scenario

A fictional company has:

- Finance, HR, IT, and SOC teams.
- On-premises Active Directory.
- Microsoft 365.
- Cloud storage.
- Payroll SaaS.
- A PAM platform.

Current findings:

- Users receive access copied from coworkers.
- Movers retain old groups.
- Three shared administrator accounts exist.
- Service accounts have no owners.
- Vendors never expire.
- Break-glass accounts are untested.

### Tasks

1. Define five business roles.
2. Map each role to technical entitlements.
3. Identify three toxic combinations.
4. Design joiner, mover, and leaver workflows.
5. Replace shared admin use with a PAM design.
6. Define service-account ownership and credential controls.
7. Design a quarterly privileged review.
8. Define ten IAM alerts.
9. Classify controls by category and function.

### Access Matrix

| Role | Resource | Read | Modify | Approve | Admin | Duration |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

### Instructor Checks

- Roles represent job functions.
- Access is scoped and time-bound.
- Approval and provisioning are separate.
- Movers remove old access.
- Emergency access remains usable and monitored.
- Direct assignments are exceptions.

<a id="lesson-20-section-38"></a>
