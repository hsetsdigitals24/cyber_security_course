# Tool Lab 06 - Wazuh SIEM/XDR Operations

## Purpose

Wazuh gives students practical SOC experience: endpoint agents, log collection, file integrity monitoring, alert search, triage, tuning, and telemetry troubleshooting.

## Scenario

H-SETS needs visibility into Linux and Windows activity. You will deploy or use a Wazuh manager, onboard endpoints, generate benign security events, confirm alerts, and write a triage note.

## Systems

| System | Role | Example address |
|---|---|---|
| Wazuh server | Manager, indexer, dashboard | `10.10.40.10` |
| Ubuntu Server | Linux agent | `10.10.20.20` |
| Windows Server/client | Windows agent | `10.10.20.10` or `10.10.10.50` |
| Kali | Test source | `10.10.10.60` |
| pfSense | Firewall/log source | Segment gateways |

## Required Starting Materials

Before starting, confirm:

| Requirement | Minimum standard |
|---|---|
| Wazuh server VM | Installed or instructor-prepared, reachable at `10.10.40.10` |
| Ubuntu agent VM | Running and reachable at `10.10.20.20` |
| Windows agent VM | Windows Server or Windows client available for agent installation |
| Kali VM | Available for generating approved test events |
| Time synchronization | All systems have reasonable time and timezone settings |
| Credentials | Stored safely and not pasted into reports |
| Network path | Agent systems can reach the Wazuh server on required ports |

Recommended Wazuh server resources:

| Resource | Minimum | Better classroom experience |
|---|---:|---:|
| CPU | 2 cores | 4 cores |
| RAM | 4 GB | 8 GB or more |
| Disk | 50 GB | 100 GB or more |

If Wazuh is not already installed, the instructor should provide either an instructor-prepared Wazuh VM or an approved installation guide for the current Wazuh version. Students should preserve the installation evidence, but they must not publish generated passwords, certificates, tokens, or enrollment secrets.

Common Wazuh ports in this lab:

| Port | Protocol | Purpose |
|---:|---|---|
| `1514` | TCP or UDP depending on configuration | Agent event forwarding |
| `1515` | TCP | Agent enrollment and registration |
| `443` | TCP | Dashboard access |
| `9200` | TCP | Indexer API, normally restricted to trusted administration |

## Step 1 - Prepare Evidence

```bash
mkdir -p ~/hsets-evidence/wazuh-tool-lab/{01-manager,02-agents,03-events,04-alerts,05-troubleshooting,06-report}
date -u +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ' | tee ~/hsets-evidence/wazuh-tool-lab/session-start-utc.txt
script -af ~/hsets-evidence/wazuh-tool-lab/command-log.txt
```

## Step 2 - Verify Wazuh Manager Health

On `wazuh01`:

```bash
hostnamectl | tee ~/hsets-evidence/wazuh-tool-lab/01-manager/hostname.txt
ip -br address | tee ~/hsets-evidence/wazuh-tool-lab/01-manager/ip-address.txt
free -h | tee ~/hsets-evidence/wazuh-tool-lab/01-manager/memory.txt
df -h / | tee ~/hsets-evidence/wazuh-tool-lab/01-manager/disk.txt
sudo systemctl status wazuh-manager wazuh-indexer wazuh-dashboard filebeat --no-pager \
  | tee ~/hsets-evidence/wazuh-tool-lab/01-manager/service-status.txt
sudo /var/ossec/bin/wazuh-control status | tee ~/hsets-evidence/wazuh-tool-lab/01-manager/wazuh-control.txt
sudo ss -lntp | grep -E ':1514|:1515|:443|:9200' \
  | tee ~/hsets-evidence/wazuh-tool-lab/01-manager/listeners.txt
```

Also record time status:

```bash
date -u | tee ~/hsets-evidence/wazuh-tool-lab/01-manager/manager-time-utc.txt
timedatectl | tee ~/hsets-evidence/wazuh-tool-lab/01-manager/manager-timedatectl.txt
```

If Wazuh is not installed, stop and use the instructor-approved installation path. Do not continue with agent onboarding until the manager, indexer, dashboard, and Filebeat are healthy.

## Step 3 - Onboard Ubuntu Agent

On Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo systemctl status wazuh-agent --no-pager
sudo grep -nA3 '<server>' /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf
sudo tail -n 50 /var/ossec/logs/ossec.log
nc -vz -w 3 10.10.40.10 1514
nc -vz -w 3 10.10.40.10 1515
```

If the agent is not installed, install it using the current package method approved by the instructor and set:

```text
WAZUH_MANAGER=10.10.40.10
WAZUH_AGENT_NAME=lin01
```

Beginner installation flow:

1. In the Wazuh dashboard, open the agent deployment or agent enrollment page.
2. Choose Linux DEB or RPM based on the Ubuntu system.
3. Enter manager address `10.10.40.10`.
4. Set agent name `lin01`.
5. Copy only the generated installation command into the Ubuntu terminal.
6. Run the command on Ubuntu.
7. Start or restart the Wazuh agent.
8. Confirm the agent appears as active in the dashboard.

Do not paste generated enrollment keys or passwords into the lab report.

On the manager:

```bash
sudo /var/ossec/bin/agent_control -lc | tee ~/hsets-evidence/wazuh-tool-lab/02-agents/agent-list.txt
```

Expected result: `lin01` appears in the agent list and shows as active after a short delay.

## Step 4 - Onboard Windows Agent

On Windows:

1. Install the Wazuh agent using the approved installer.
2. Set the manager IP to `10.10.40.10`.
3. Name the agent clearly, such as `win11-01` or `dc01`.
4. Start the agent service.

Beginner installation flow:

1. In the Wazuh dashboard, open the agent deployment page.
2. Select Windows.
3. Enter manager address `10.10.40.10`.
4. Set the agent name.
5. Copy the generated PowerShell or MSI command.
6. Run PowerShell as Administrator on Windows.
7. Install the agent.
8. Start the Wazuh service.
9. Return to the Wazuh dashboard and confirm the agent is active.

PowerShell evidence:

```powershell
Get-Service WazuhSvc
Get-Content "C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent\ossec.log" -Tail 50
Test-NetConnection 10.10.40.10 -Port 1514
Test-NetConnection 10.10.40.10 -Port 1515
```

Export screenshots or text output without exposing secrets.

If the Windows agent does not appear:

| Check | Expected result |
|---|---|
| `Get-Service WazuhSvc` | Service exists and is running |
| `Test-NetConnection 10.10.40.10 -Port 1514` | TCP test succeeds if TCP is used |
| `Test-NetConnection 10.10.40.10 -Port 1515` | Enrollment path succeeds |
| Agent log | No repeated connection or enrollment errors |
| Dashboard time range | Current time window selected |

## Step 5 - Generate Linux Authentication Events

From Kali, attempt two failed SSH logins to Ubuntu, then one approved successful login.

On Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo tail -n 80 /var/log/auth.log | tee ~/hsets-evidence/wazuh-tool-lab/03-events/ubuntu-auth-events.txt
```

In Wazuh dashboard, search:

```text
agent.name: lin01 AND (sshd OR authentication)
```

If the search returns nothing, widen the time range first. Many beginner SIEM errors are search-window errors, not tool failures.

Record:

- Raw event.
- Agent name.
- Source IP.
- Username.
- Rule ID.
- Rule level.
- Timestamp.
- Dashboard time range.

## Step 6 - Generate File Integrity Monitoring Event

On Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo install -d -o root -g root -m 0755 /opt/hsets-critical
echo 'approved baseline' | sudo tee /opt/hsets-critical/config.txt
echo 'authorised change' | sudo tee -a /opt/hsets-critical/config.txt
```

If `/opt/hsets-critical` is not monitored, add it under the Wazuh agent syscheck configuration using instructor-approved syntax, validate configuration, and restart the agent.

Find the FIM alert in Wazuh and explain why file change is not automatically malicious.

## Step 7 - Generate Windows Security Events

On Windows, perform:

1. One failed logon.
2. One successful logon.
3. One test local user creation or group membership change if authorised.

PowerShell evidence:

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; Id=4624,4625,4720,4732; StartTime=(Get-Date).AddHours(-2)} |
  Select-Object TimeCreated,Id,ProviderName,Message |
  Format-List |
  Out-File C:\H-SETS-Wazuh-Windows-Events.txt
```

Search Wazuh for the same time window and record matching alerts.

## Step 8 - Triage One Alert

Complete this triage note:

```text
Alert title:
Rule ID and level:
Agent:
Source IP:
User:
Observed behavior:
Confirmed evidence:
Possible benign explanation:
Possible malicious explanation:
CIA impact:
Recommended action:
Severity:
Reason for severity:
```

Analyst decision options:

| Decision | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Benign true positive | The activity happened, but it was authorized or expected |
| Suspicious | The activity needs more investigation |
| Incident | Evidence shows security impact or active compromise |
| False positive | The alert did not represent the activity claimed |
| Tuning candidate | The alert is valid but too noisy for its current level or condition |

Students must not call an alert an incident only because it is red or high severity. They must explain evidence, impact, and recommended response.

## Step 9 - Simulate Telemetry Failure

With instructor approval, stop the Ubuntu agent for five minutes:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop wazuh-agent
date -u
```

Observe dashboard and manager status. Recover:

```bash
sudo systemctl start wazuh-agent
sudo systemctl is-active wazuh-agent
sudo tail -n 50 /var/ossec/logs/ossec.log
```

Explain why a disconnected security agent is a risk.

## Step 10 - Tune One Noisy Alert

Choose one alert that is expected in the lab. Do not disable monitoring globally. Write a tuning recommendation:

```text
Alert:
Why it is noisy:
What risk remains:
Recommended tuning:
Who approves:
Review date:
```

## Deliverables

- Wazuh manager health evidence.
- Ubuntu agent evidence.
- Windows agent evidence.
- Linux authentication alert.
- FIM alert.
- Windows security alert.
- One triage note.
- Telemetry failure and recovery timeline.
- Tuning recommendation.
- Management summary.

## Pass Condition

The student passes when they can trace an event from endpoint log to Wazuh alert, explain the alert professionally, troubleshoot telemetry failure, and recommend proportionate response.

### Preflight Checklist

```text
Wazuh server IP:
Ubuntu agent IP:
Windows agent IP:
Dashboard URL:
Instructor-approved credentials stored safely:
Time synchronized:
Firewall permits agent ports:
No production logs used:
```

### Wazuh Data Flow

Students must be able to explain this chain:

```text
Endpoint event
 -> Wazuh agent
 -> Wazuh manager
 -> Decoder/rule
 -> Indexer
 -> Dashboard search
 -> Analyst triage
 -> Recommendation
```

If an alert is missing, test the chain from left to right. Do not start by changing rules.

### Required Health Checks

On the manager:

```bash
sudo /var/ossec/bin/wazuh-control status
sudo /var/ossec/bin/agent_control -lc
sudo systemctl status wazuh-manager wazuh-indexer wazuh-dashboard filebeat --no-pager
sudo journalctl -u wazuh-manager -n 50 --no-pager
```

On Linux agent:

```bash
sudo systemctl status wazuh-agent --no-pager
sudo tail -n 80 /var/ossec/logs/ossec.log
```

On Windows agent:

```powershell
Get-Service WazuhSvc
Get-Content "C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent\ossec.log" -Tail 80
```

### Alert Evidence Standard

For every alert, record:

```text
Alert name:
Rule ID:
Rule level:
Agent name:
Agent IP:
Source event time:
Dashboard/index time:
User:
Source IP:
Raw event:
Analyst interpretation:
Recommended action:
```

### Linux Event Exercise

Generate only benign activity:

1. Failed SSH login.
2. Successful approved SSH login.
3. Approved file creation or modification.

The student must show:

- Local Ubuntu log.
- Wazuh raw event or alert.
- Dashboard search filter.
- Explanation of what is confirmed.
- Explanation of what is not confirmed.

### Windows Event Exercise

Generate only instructor-approved activity:

1. Failed Windows logon.
2. Successful Windows logon.
3. Test local user or group change if allowed.

The student must connect:

- Windows Event Viewer evidence.
- Wazuh evidence.
- Rule ID or indexed fields.
- Analyst triage decision.

### Troubleshooting Matrix

| Problem | First place to check | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| No local event | Endpoint log | Wazuh cannot collect what does not exist |
| Agent disconnected | Agent service/log | Collection path is broken |
| Agent connected but no alert | Rules/decoder/search | Event may be indexed but not alerted |
| Dashboard shows wrong time | Time range/time zone | Many missed alerts are search-window problems |
| Linux event present, Wazuh missing | Agent config and manager ports | Collection or transport issue |
| Windows event present, Wazuh missing | Agent event channel config | Channel may not be collected |

### Triage Report Template

```text
Title: Wazuh Alert Triage Report

1. Alert Summary
2. Scope
3. Evidence
4. Analysis
5. Severity
6. Recommended Response
7. Tuning Recommendation
8. Management Summary
```

### Student Must Explain

- Why agent health matters.
- Why time synchronization matters.
- Why a failed login alone is not automatically an incident.
- Why file integrity monitoring proves a change but not attacker intent.
- Why alert tuning must not hide real risk.

### Entry-Level SOC Job Readiness Check

The student is ready to move forward when they can:

| Skill | Student can demonstrate |
|---|---|
| SIEM data flow | Explain endpoint log, agent, manager, decoder, rule, indexer, dashboard, triage |
| Agent operations | Onboard Linux and Windows agents and prove they are active |
| Alert search | Use agent name, event text, user, source IP, and time range to find evidence |
| Triage | Separate benign, suspicious, incident, false positive, and tuning candidate |
| Troubleshooting | Identify whether a missing alert is caused by endpoint logging, agent health, network ports, time range, or rule logic |
| Communication | Write a clear triage note and management summary |
